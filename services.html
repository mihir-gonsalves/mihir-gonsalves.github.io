            <h2>What Inspires Me</h2>
            <p>
                Born and raised in Canada up to the age of twelve, I had many role models to look up to, but the one who shaped
                my goals and dreams to revolve around a future in engineering is Terry Fox. Terry Fox was a 19-year-old
                who lost his leg to bone cancer and later had a prosthetic leg fitted on to him. The Canadian icon is celebrated
                for the strength, perseverance, and humanitarianism he showed during his <a href = "https://terryfox.org/" target="_blank">"Marathon of Hope,"</a> in which he ran 
                3,339 miles across Canada in 143 days on a prosthetic leg, raising over $24 million towards cancer research in 
                the process. Although Terry Fox died in 1981 at the age of 22, he continues to inspire Canadians to complete the
                "Terry Fox Run" every year in September and raise money towards cancer research. Having watched documentaries 
                that show him running on a prosthetic leg has inspired me to work towards a career in engineering, where I hope 
                to emulate the same strength, perseverance, and humanitarianism that Terry Fox showed. What may seem small in 
                the grand scheme of things can create a domino effect that ultimately impacts the entire world. What I see in 
                this field is a maze of innovation that eventually leads to an open landscape that has possibilities to impact 
                the world in numerous ways. Academically, I have one goal, to gain a depth of knowledge in the field of computer 
                engineering so I can move around freely to help anyone, no matter what dilemma they are facing. Nothing matters 
                more to me than helping those around me. I believe in my potential to not only change a singular person's perspective 
                but a whole community of people around the globe. Although technology has already advanced an incredible amount 
                so far, there is still an inconceivable distance remaining to cover. One of my career goals in life is to establish 
                a non-profit organization that works to cover as much of that unknown distance as possible through research and 
                innovation. The bleeding-edge technology we create would then be sold at an affordable cost to people who need 
                it but cannot pay for it otherwise. It would be impossible to accomplish this alone, so my first step to transform 
                that dream into a reality will be building an affiliation between all the like-minded colleagues I meet in college 
                and life's journey who possess similar ambitions. Even when I accomplish this goal, I will continue pushing forwards 
                to achieve all the other goals I make in the process. I do not simply want to reach a pinnacle goal in my career 
                but instead, want to see how far I could progress past it, hopefully impacting the world in a way that will continue 
                to help those in need for generations, even when I am gone.

            <p>
                Taught children from ages 7-12 about Lego EV3 Robotics, of which they could build and program lego robots to hopefully
                develop a passion for engineering and possibly pursue a career in the field when they're older.

                Traveled to Quito, Ecuador with 10 peers to renovate an all girls orphanage to build trust with the community,
                inspired students ages 5-18 to pursue careers in engineering by teaching them about WeDo and EV3 Robotics, and
                launched a <a href = "https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc" target="_blank">FIRST Robotics Competition</a> team at a local high school.
